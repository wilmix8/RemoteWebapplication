Definition:
=============

  "Remote  webserver  application    is defiened  as  an  application    operates    with
  client-server.but  it  will  post  and  get  objects   from  server that  can  be
  
  exchanged through out  sessions  or  with  in   two   computers  ;  where   as   one  act   as  client
  
  and  other  act   as   server" 


  
  eg)  When  you enter   details  using  CH$  program  that   creates   a   data  object
  
  called  as .dsn  file;  that can  be  exchanged  through  out   sessions.

  
  Difference  between   webserver  and  remoteserver  means   remotserver  

has   remote-client  connection  but  webserver don't have.


Data flow  is  unknown   using  J$  architecture with  J$AGENT in  VS-OS.  where   as  in   

webserver  and  application server  like  tomcat,JSTAR SERVER,Jboss server,  etc;  here  dataflow  is  known.

JSTAR  webserver   is used   only   for  webdesign  so   we  don't  focus   remoteserver.

In webserver  data  will   be   sent  between  client(browser)  and  server

is  known  to users.

so  this   indicates   webserver   has  no  security  but  remoteserver  using  J$  architecture

has  more   security  according  to  research.

Remoteserver   uses http +  socket  connection    where   as webserver uses   only  http  connection

Remote web  application server  =>  webserver  +  Applicationserver +  datasecurity.



So J$ is  most  advanced in  security   side. but  it  has  more  framework  and  latest technology

and  follows  shortest  code    than  any  technology and  including  advanced  business and  many  advantages

over  other  technologies. When  you  host   Jdollar  or  Chdollar  Servers   in  any  of  your   today

available   hosting   provider.  You   can   see  Jdollar  or   Chdollar   website   at  your  mobile phone

or  at  internet.


SO   Hosting    is  mandaltory   for  CHDollar  p.L  and  Jdollar  p.l   to  publish   the  webpages.


eg)  CHDollar, JDollar(JWEB)   are  the  examples..


b)  JX-MEM RemoteWebapplication



It  is  the   remotewebapplication   using  Vast  Memory  management  


using  JDollar(JWEB)  Technology...


eg)  J$MEM ,  J$WEBMEM  are  the  examples...




c)  AX- Remote WebApplication
 



It  is   the   RemoteWebapplication   using   DOTWEBSAUCER devices  like  


Tabernacle , SLING, J$SAUCER ,etc   are   the  examples


d)  MX -Remote Webapplication
 


It  is   the  RemoteWebapplication  using  machine learning  concepts

eg) OAKJAVA7




e)  AMX-  Remote Webapplication
   


It  is   the  RemoteWebapplication  using  Automation  and  with  Big data concepts.



eg) DOTWEB2.0
